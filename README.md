## Implementation ##

Uses the SOE libraries to implement chat features in a standalone utility. Ideally, the completed implementation would allow for multiple galaxies to connect and allow players to communicate across them.

## External Dependencies ##

* c++14 compatible compiler
* boost::program_options
* sqlite3
* udplibrary - bundled in the Star Wars Galaxies official source

## Building ##

    chmod 777 build.sh
    ./build.sh

## Database Initialization ##

By default, a clean database instance is provided and placed with the default configuration files in the **build/bin** directory; therefore, nothing needs to be done for new installations, the db is already created and placed in the appropriate location.

To create a new, clean database instance, use the following commands:

    sqlite3 chat.db
    sqlite> .read /path/to/extras/init_database.sql

Then update the **database_path** config option with the full path to the database.

## Running ##

A default configuration and database is created when building the project. Configure the listen address/ports in **build/bin/stationchat.cfg**. Then run the following commands from the project root:

### Linux ###

    cd build/bin
    ./stationchat

## Final Notes ##

It is recommended to copy the **build/bin** directory to another location after building to ensure the configuration files are not overwritten by future changes to the default versions of these files.
